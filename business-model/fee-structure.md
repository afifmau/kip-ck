- Transparent and predictable

## 2. Percentage Fee (Optional)

- 0.1% per transaction (recommended for micro-transactions)

- Includes:
  - Higher bandwidth allocation
  - Discounted rate

- Tailored to volume: Bronze / Silver / Gold Tiers

## 4. Special Case: Unverified Contracts

- Smart contracts not verified via our system will be charged higher (e.g., $0.1/tx)
- Purpose: to encourage best practices and ensure security
- Can switch to verified status anytime for discounted fees


KIP-CK reserves the right to adjust fees based on network load and security updates, with prior notice.
