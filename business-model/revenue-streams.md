Revenue Streams – KIP-CK Protocol

The KIP-CK Protocol monetizes cross-chain interoperability through diverse and ethical channels. Revenue is generated with fairness, accessibility, and scalability in mind.



1. Cross-Chain Execution Fees

A small fee (~$0.01–$0.02) is applied only when a transaction crosses chains.

Intra-chain transactions remain free.

This helps sustain relayer infrastructure and protocol upkeep.




2. Subscription Plans

Monthly or annual plans for high-frequency users (e.g., wallets, bridges, or dApps).

Includes reserved relayer slots, priority throughput, and SLA-backed support.




3. Relayer-as-a-Service (RaaS)

Enterprises and apps can rent or deploy KIP-compatible relayers under a white-label license.

Ideal for wallets, custodians, or enterprise DeFi players.




4. Enterprise Integration Packages

For large ecosystems requiring custom deployment, audits, or governance alignment.

Pricing via direct negotiation or SLA agreement.




5. Verified Contract Discounts

Smart contracts that pass KIP verification get discounted fees (as low as $0.005 per tx).

Incentivizes secure practices and reduces systemic risk.

6. NFT-based Agreements (Optional)
