#  Future Plans – Aptos Integration

The KIP-CK Protocol plans to expand Aptos integration through the following phases:

---

##  Phase 1 – MVP (Current)

- Demo simulation using Aptos SDK
- Manual relayer interaction
- Basic signature verification contract in Move

---

##  Phase 2 – Testnet Contract Deployment

- Deploy working Move smart contracts on Aptos testnet
- Include intent handling, signature verification, and tx execution
- Enable real relayer-to-chain interaction

---

##  Phase 3 – Automation

- Fully automate off-chain signing + on-chain execution
- Build unified relayer to support Aptos alongside EVM chains

---

##  Phase 4 – Interoperability Layer

- Develop cross-chain message standard between Aptos ↔ EVM
- Explore ZK-proof-based verification between different chains

---

##  Developer Support

- Provide templates, example repos, and CLI tools for Aptos devs
- Maintain KIP-CK Aptos SDK wrapper if needed

---

> These plans may evolve based on Aptos ecosystem growth and feedback from grant reviewers.
