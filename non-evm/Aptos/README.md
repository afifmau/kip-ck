# ðŸ”— KIP-CK x Aptos Integration

This folder contains documentation and simulation code for integrating the **KIP-CK Protocol** into the **Aptos** blockchain ecosystem.

KIP-CK enables secure, efficient, and verifiable **cross-chain transactions** between Aptos and other chains such as EVM-based chains and Sui.

##  Goals of This Integration

- Enable **intent-based signing and relaying** from Aptos to other chains
- Ensure cryptographic **proof verification** and **payload execution**
- Maintain compatibility with KIP-CK's universal relayer and verifier modules

## Status

This section is currently **under development** and will evolve based on:
- Developer feedback
- Grant reviewer comments
- Real testnet usage
