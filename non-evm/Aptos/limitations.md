 Limitations â€“ Aptos Integration

This document outlines current known limitations and challenges related to integrating the KIP-CK Protocol with the Aptos blockchain.




 Smart Contract Constraints

Limited Interoperability Primitives:
Aptos does not natively support cross-chain communication primitives. Custom implementation of verification logic is required.

Resource Model Complexity:
The Move language's resource-oriented programming adds learning curve and complexity for signature/state management.





 Tooling & Ecosystem

SDK Ecosystem Still Maturing:
Aptos SDKs (especially JavaScript and Python) are improving but might lack some features compared to EVM ecosystems.

Testing Infrastructure:
Testnet faucet limitations and lack of robust local dev tools can slow integration testing.





 Security Considerations

Signature validation must be fully deterministic and reproducible

Off-chain relayers must ensure payload authenticity before submitting to Aptos chain

Malformed or duplicated payloads can lead to failed transactions or wasted gas





 Potential Workarounds

Use KIP-CK relayer modules to preprocess and filter signed intents

Store verified intents on a dedicated Aptos module for future querying

Collaborate with Aptos community for co-developing cross-chain libraries





 These limitations will be monitored and solutions proposed in future iterations of the KIP-CK Protocol.
