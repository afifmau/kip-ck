 Limitations – ICP Integration (KIP-CK Protocol)

This document highlights the current limitations and challenges faced in the ICP integration of the KIP-CK Protocol.


---

1. Lack of Native EVM Compatibility

ICP does not support EVM out of the box.

Requires custom serialization, decoding, and signature logic for Ethereum-based assets.

Increases development overhead compared to EVM-native chains.



---

2.  Cross-Chain Messaging Constraints

No standardized cross-chain messaging interface like IBC or LayerZero on ICP.

All relayer logic must be custom-built.

Risk: inconsistencies in payload structure across chains.



---

3. Signature Format Divergence

EVM uses secp256k1 signatures, ICP supports Ed25519 or ECDSA via threshold crypto.

Cross-verification between signature formats adds complexity.

Canister must implement validation manually unless standardized in future.



---

4. Execution Latency

ICP canister calls have some delay compared to EVM txs.

Multi-step transactions (intent, relay, execution) may feel slow in real time.



---

5.  Tooling Immaturity

Fewer libraries for simulation or SDK abstraction (e.g., web3.js vs. ICP’s agent-js).

Limits rapid prototyping and developer onboarding.

Requires custom wrapper functions for basic operations.



---

6. Storage & Cycles Cost

Each canister consumes cycles for compute and storage.

High-frequency use may become costly if not optimized.

Requires efficient code and storage minimization strategies.



---

7. Developer Learning Curve

Motoko and Candid are unfamiliar to most EVM or Rust devs.

Slower community onboarding without solid documentation.



---

 Mitigation Strategies

Provide helper SDKs or wrappers for easier dev experience.

Implement relayer abstraction to unify logic across chains.

Introduce verification libraries and testing harnesses for simulation.

Use Lighthouse and DAO-based registries to validate incoming payloads.
