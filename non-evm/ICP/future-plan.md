 Future Plan â€“ ICP Integration (KIP-CK Protocol)

This document outlines future enhancements and milestones for the KIP-CK Protocol's Internet Computer (ICP) integration.


---

 1. Native Signature Verification Module

Goal: Remove reliance on external libraries for signature verification.

Method: Utilize built-in crypto in Motoko or Wasm modules (ECDSA/Ed25519).

Impact: Increases efficiency and reduces attack surface.



---

 2. Modular Execution Engine

Goal: Support multiple types of cross-chain actions (mint, call, update).

Design: Plug-in based action handler inside the canister.

Use Case: dApps can register new action types via proposals.



---

 3. Lighthouse Oracle Integration

Objective: Fetch and verify external chain data using ICP Lighthouse.

Benefit: Adds real-time on-chain data verification without bridges.

Status: In research phase.



---

 4. Public Testnet Deployment

Plan: Deploy the ICP version of KIP-CK to testnet.

Steps:

Deploy minimal canister prototype

Integrate with relayer CLI/web tool

Open to external testers




---

 5. Formal Verification & Audit

Focus: Improve security and reliability

Goal: Ensure canister logic meets audit-grade quality

Tools: Consider use of Motoko Analyzer or candid-fuzz



---

 6. ICRC-1 Token Support

Aim: Support ICP-native fungible tokens (ICRC-1)

Purpose: Enable token bridging to/from ICP

Milestone: Post-testnet integration



---

 7. DAO Governance Integration

Enable DAO or community-driven control for:

Protocol upgrades

Fee settings

Whitelisted contracts
