#  ICP Integration Architecture – KIP-CK

This document explains the architectural components and data flow of KIP-CK integration on the Internet Computer (ICP).

---

##  Core Components

1. **Canister Smart Contracts**  
   Host the logic for receiving cross-chain payloads, verifying signatures, and executing on-chain actions.

2. **Relayer**  
   Acts as the off-chain executor that:
   - Collects signed intents from users
   - Forwards them to the appropriate canister on ICP

3. **Off-Chain Signer (User)**  
   The user signs an off-chain message (cross-chain intent) before broadcasting to the relayer.

4. **Bridge-Free Communication Layer**  
   Instead of using bridges, KIP-CK uses message-passing relayers between EVM and ICP using standardized formats.

 Key Technical Details

Signature Verification: Done within the canister using supported crypto libs (e.g., ECDSA secp256k1).

No Bridges Required: Relayer operates trust-minimized using off-chain message flow.

Deterministic Execution: Once verified, the canister triggers ledger update or app logic (e.g., minting, state change).



---

 Security Considerations

Intent validation includes timestamp, origin chain, and signature.

Canister whitelists allowed relayers to prevent spoofing.

Optional meta-tx replay protection with unique nonce.



---

Future Extensions

Native Lighthouse oracle integration (real-world triggers)

Support for more signing schemes (Ed25519, BLS)

Integration with SNS DAO logic for decentralized execution policies

✅ This modular architecture enables future upgrades, multichain expansion, and composable on-chain services on ICP without relying on traditional bridges.
