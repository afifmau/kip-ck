 ICP Integration Architecture â€“ KIP-CK Protocol

This document outlines the architecture design for integrating KIP-CK Protocol with the Internet Computer (ICP), focusing on cross-chain messaging, canister interactions, and relayer mechanisms.

 Key Components

1. Source Chain (EVM or Non-EVM)

Origin of transaction intent

Signs payload to be relayed to ICP


2. KIP-CK Relayer

Off-chain component responsible for forwarding signed payloads

Verifies signature off-chain or inside a verification canister

Sends intent to the target ICP canister


3. ICP Canister (Destination Logic)

Receives the payload

Verifies signature using built-in or imported verification module

Executes logic (e.g., mint token, update state)

 Optional Modules

Lighthouse Oracle (future): Used to fetch Ethereum state to ICP

Threshold Signers / Validators: To increase trust minimization in relayer

Canister Logs / Analytics: For traceability and audit trails



---

 Trust Assumptions

Signature verification is reliable inside canister

Relayer is honest-but-verifiable (or replicated by multiple nodes)

EVM source chain provides cryptographic guarantees of payload origin



---

 Notes

ICP has no native EVM compatibility; relayer plays a key role

The model can be extended to support multi-hop relaying, token bridging, or wrapped assets

For demo purposes, payloads can be simplified (e.g., simple intent message + timestamp)
