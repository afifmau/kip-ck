 Smart Contract Overview – ICP Canister (KIP-CK)

This document provides an overview of the smart contract (canister) logic used in the Internet Computer (ICP) integration for the KIP-CK Protocol.


---

 Canister Roles

1. Intent Receiver

Accepts signed cross-chain payloads (submitted by relayer)

Verifies signatures off-chain or with built-in crypto modules



2. Transaction Executor

Based on verified intent, executes a corresponding action (e.g., minting tokens, triggering business logic)



3. State Storage

Tracks verified intents, status, timestamps, origin chain, etc.

Prevents double execution or replay attacks



4. Logging & Auditing

Optionally stores logs for intent history and traceability





---

 Key Functions

Function	Description

receive_intent(payload: IntentPayload)	Entry point for relayers to submit cross-chain intent
verify_signature(payload: IntentPayload)	Checks if the payload is valid (ECDSA/Ed25519)
execute_action(data: IntentPayload)	Executes logic based on the intent type
get_tx_status(tx_id: string)	Returns the status of a specific transaction
admin_set_fee(amount: Nat)	Admin-only function to set protocol fees



---

 IntentPayload Structure

type IntentPayload = {
  origin_chain: Text;
  sender: Text;
  signature: Blob;
  action: Text;
  metadata: Text;
  timestamp: Nat64;
};


---

 Security Measures

Replays are prevented using a hashed intent ID registry

Signature checks ensure only valid cross-chain actions are processed

Optional fee enforcement can be enabled via admin toggle



---

 Future Considerations

Modularization of actions (plug-in execution modules)

Integration with ICP Lighthouse for external verification

Token standard extension (ICRC-1 or custom)



---

 Summary

This canister acts as the execution endpoint for KIP-CK’s cross-chain protocol on ICP. It is responsible for validating, executing, and recording cross-chain interactions securely.

# ICP Canister Contract – KIP-CK Integration

This section outlines the smart contract (canister) logic used in KIP-CK for handling cross-chain transactions on the Internet Computer.

---

##  Contract Responsibilities

- Receive signed intent from relayer
- Validate payload format and basic structure
- Emit event or log entry for downstream processing
- Optional: Simulate cross-chain call execution

---

## Key Methods

### `submit_intent(intent: Text)`
Receives a signed intent payload as a string.  
Logs the incoming payload and returns confirmation.

```motoko
public shared(msg) func submit_intent(intent: Text) : async Text {
  Debug.print("Received cross-chain intent: " # intent);
  return "✅ Intent received successfully";
};

get_intent_log()

Returns a log of all received intents (for debugging or UI demo display).


---

 Security Considerations

Currently accepts any payload — for simulation purposes only.

Signature validation logic will be added in production phase.

Permissions will be enforced through canister access control and verification layers.



---

 Notes

This is a minimal canister for demo/testing purposes.

Real-world integration will require additional modules for signature checks and relayer verification.

ICP’s native features like stable memory and on-chain cycles metering will be used in production-grade deployments.

##  Additional Prototype Notes

Below is a minimal canister logic used in the KIP-CK simulation phase.  
It does not perform real signature checks, but is designed to show the end-to-end submission and logging of cross-chain intents.

```motoko
public shared(msg) func submit_intent(intent: Text) : async Text {
  Debug.print("Received cross-chain intent: " # intent);
  return "✅ Intent received successfully";
};
