#  ICP Smart Contract – Contract Overview

This document outlines the initial design and simulated prototype of the smart contract component for the KIP-CK Protocol on the Internet Computer (ICP). It demonstrates how cross-chain relayed messages can be handled by a simple canister-based implementation.

---

##  Overview

KIP-CK uses canisters on ICP as a destination endpoint for cross-chain intent execution. The relayer sends signed payloads from EVM or other chains, which are then received and processed by the ICP canister.

The prototype below is written in **Motoko** and simulates basic message handling.

---

##  Conceptual Flow

1. User signs intent on the source chain.
2. Relayer forwards payload and signature to the canister.
3. Canister receives the intent and logs it.
4. (Optional) Canister performs further processing (to be added in final version).

---

## Motoko Sample Canister

```motoko
actor KipCKReceiver {
  type Intent = {
    from : Text;
    to : Text;
    amount : Nat;
    signature : Text;
  };

  var received : [Intent] = [];

  public func receiveIntent(intent : Intent) : async Text {
    received := Array.append(received, [intent]);
    return "✅ Intent received and stored.";
  };

  public query func getAllIntents() : async [Intent] {
    return received;
  };
}

>  This prototype does not yet verify signatures. Verification and on-chain execution logic will be integrated in future phases.




---

 Next Steps (Planned)

Implement signature validation for relayed payloads.

Add a logic layer to trigger execution of received transactions.

Simulate interaction with a frontend (React/Vue or Terminal).

Secure relayer endpoint via whitelisting and rate-limiting.



---

 Notes

This demo is part of the cross-chain simulation initiative for the ICP Hackathon.

Deployment target: Testnet or local dfx environment.

Gas and compute cost tracking will be analyzed during final testing.
