# 🔐 Security Model

The KIP-CK protocol is designed with a layered security model to ensure trustless, decentralized cross-chain interoperability — without bridges or wrapped assets.

---

## 🧱 Key Security Assumptions

- All payloads must be signed off-chain by the original user
- Only verified relayers can forward payloads (or anyone, if signatures are strong)
- Forwarder contracts on destination chains must be trusted and deterministic
- Replay protection via nonces or payload hashes is strictly enforced

## 🧩 Threat Scenarios & Mitigations

| Threat                              | Mitigation Strategy                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Signature spoofing                  | Uses strong cryptography (e.g., ECDSA, ED25519)     |
| Payload replay attacks              | Per-user nonce tracking and/or message hash logs    |
| Malicious relayers                  | Relayers cannot bypass signature verification       |
| Front-running signed intent         | Expiry timestamps and batched intent execution      |
| Chain-specific incompatibility      | Modular design for per-chain validation             |

## 🔄 Trust Minimization

KIP-CK does **not** rely on:

- Token bridges
- External oracles
- Centralized message relayers
- Shared sequencers

Instead, all cross-chain interactions are derived from **signed user intent + verifiable execution**.

---

## 🧪 Audit & Testing Strategy

- ✅ Unit testing of signature verification logic
- ✅ Replay simulation & double-submit rejection
- ✅ Gas exhaustion / denial-of-service simulation
- ✅ Will open for community testing on public devnet
- ❌ Not yet audited by third-party (pending funding)

---

## ✅ Summary

Security in KIP-CK is built from first principles:  
verifiable signatures, trust-minimized relaying, modular logic, and strong replay protection.  
The system can scale securely across chains without requiring centralized coordination.
