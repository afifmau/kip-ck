# KIP-CK Key Features Overview

The KIP-CK Protocol introduces a next-generation approach to cross-chain interoperability.  
This folder documents the core technical features that define the power and uniqueness of the protocol.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contract Interoperability**  
  Allowing contracts on different chains to communicate directly.

- **Gasless Architecture**  
  Users sign transactions off-chain; relayers execute them with optional subsidized gas.

- **Bridge-less Cross-chain Messaging**  
  No token wrapping, no custodial bridgesâ€”just pure message passing.

- **Permissionless Relayer Network**  
  Anyone can become a relayer and earn fees.

- **Modular Integration**  
  Supports EVM and non-EVM chains via adapters and standards.

- **Developer Tools (SDK & CLI)**  
  Seamless integration using SDKs and CLI tools.
  

Each file in this folder explains one of the above in technical detail.
