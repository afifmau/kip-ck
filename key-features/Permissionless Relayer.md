# Permissionless Relayer Network

KIP-CK allows anyone to run a relayer node to serve cross-chain requests.

## Features

- Fully open participation
- Slashing/respect mechanism (future roadmap)
- Relayers earn fees from tx they process

## Security Notes

- Relayers cannot fake execution
- Users always sign their intents
- Gas fee + execution fee are configurable
