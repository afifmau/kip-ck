# 🌉 KIP-CK – Cross-chain Interoperability Protocol

**KIP-CK** (Keyless Interoperability Protocol – Crosschain) is a next-gen, trust-minimized protocol that enables **secure cross-chain execution without bridges, wrapped assets, or native gas**.

It works on both **EVM and non-EVM chains** using:
- ✅ Off-chain signed intent
- ✅ Meta-transactions
- ✅ Trusted forwarders
- ✅ Modular relayers

---

## 🚀 Why KIP-CK?

🔐 **Bridge-less**  
No locking. No wrapping. No honeypots. Assets and logic stay native.

⚡ **Gasless UX**  
Users can interact cross-chain without holding native gas on the destination chain.

🔁 **Chain-agnostic**  
Works across EVM and non-EVM chains (e.g., Ethereum, Aptos, Cosmos, Sui).

🧱 **Modular**  
Plug-and-play components. Choose your own relayer, signature format, and VM adapter.

🧑‍💻 **Open standard**  
KIP-CK is a protocol, not a product. Use it freely, fork it, or extend it.

## 🧠 How It Works

> **"Sign on Chain A. Execute on Chain B."**

1. User signs an **off-chain message** containing:
   - origin & destination chain ID
   - calldata (what to do)
   - expiration & nonce
   - signature

2. A **relayer** submits it to Chain B’s **Trusted Forwarder**

3. The forwarder:
   - Verifies the signature
   - Executes the logic on behalf of the user (`msg.sender = user`)
   - Records result

📦 No need to lock funds on source chain.  
🛡 No third-party bridges or wrapped tokens.  
🧩 Works even between **EVM ↔ Non-EVM**.
