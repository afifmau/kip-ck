# ðŸ”— KIP-CK Protocol

**KIP-CK** (Kinetic Interchain Protocol â€“ Cross-chain) is a modular and gas-abstracted protocol for seamless cross-chain interactions **without bridges**. Built for scalability, security, and developer simplicity.

##  Key Concepts

-  **No Bridge Required**: Uses intent-based meta-tx across chains.
-  **Smart Verifier Logic**: Ensures authenticity before cross-chain execution.
-  **Modular Security**: Optional signature tiers and fee discounts based on verifier trust.
-  **Low-Fee Relaying**: $0.01â€“$0.02 estimated per cross-chain execution.
-  **Dev-friendly**: Free on testnet/devnet with simple integration steps.
