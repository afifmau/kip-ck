# Bug Bounty Program ‚Äì KIP-CK Protocol

We value the contributions of ethical hackers and developers who help keep the KIP-CK Protocol secure. Our Bug Bounty Program rewards those who identify vulnerabilities or critical issues in our smart contracts, relayer logic, and cross-chain infrastructure.

## Scope

The following components are **in-scope** for the bounty:

- Smart contracts deployed on supported chains (EVM and non-EVM)
- Relayer infrastructure and APIs
- Signature verification & replay protection
- Gasless transaction mechanisms
- NFT-based legal verification system



## Out of Scope

- Bugs in third-party dependencies (unless impacting KIP-CK security)
- Issues in non-production (devnet/testnet) deployments without critical impact
- UI/UX issues, typos, or suggestions unrelated to core security
