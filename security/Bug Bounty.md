# Bug Bounty Program

> **Note:** This bug bounty program is currently in pre-launch phase. Rewards will be activated once funding is secured via grants or partnerships.

We believe in community-driven security. If you discover a bug, vulnerability, or exploit in the KIP-CK Protocol, please report it responsibly.




# Bug Bounty Program – KIP-CK Protocol

We value the contributions of ethical hackers and developers who help keep the KIP-CK Protocol secure. Our Bug Bounty Program rewards those who identify vulnerabilities or critical issues in our smart contracts, relayer logic, and cross-chain infrastructure.



## Scope

The following components are **in-scope** for the bounty:

- Smart contracts deployed on supported chains (EVM and non-EVM)
- Relayer infrastructure and APIs
- Signature verification & replay protection
- Gasless transaction mechanisms
- NFT-based legal verification system



## Out of Scope

- Bugs in third-party dependencies (unless impacting KIP-CK security)
- Issues in non-production (devnet/testnet) deployments without critical impact
- UI/UX issues, typos, or suggestions unrelated to core security



## Reward Tiers (Based on Severity)

| Severity | Description                          | Bounty Range       |
|----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Critical | Fund loss, signature hijack, RCE     | $500 – $1,000+ USD |
| High     | Major DoS, relayer bypass            | $250 – $500 USD    |
| Medium   | Cross-chain logic flaws              | $100 – $250 USD    |
| Low      | Minor validation issues              | $25 – $100 USD     |

*Final reward is based on reproducibility, severity, and quality of report.*
