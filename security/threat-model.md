# Threat Model â€“ KIP-CK Protocol

This document outlines the potential threat vectors and associated risks relevant to the KIP-CK Protocol, particularly its cross-chain and relayer components.

---

## 1. Threat Categories

### A. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflows/underflows
- Delegatecall injection
- Misconfigured access control

### B. Cross-Chain Specific Risks
- Malicious message injection
- Inconsistent state replay
- Chain reorg desynchronization
- Message tampering during relay

### C. Signature & Verification Risks
- Fake user intents
- Signature replay across chains
- Improper signature encoding/decoding

### D. Relayer Compromise
- Key leakage from relayer node
- Data tampering during meta-transaction forwarding
- Sybil relayers attempting DoS

### E. Governance & Configuration Risks
- Sybil attacks on protocol upgrades
- Malicious config push by compromised governance



## 2. Assumptions

- The relayer uses TLS-secured connections and rate-limiting.
- The user wallet signs using EIP-712 typed data structures.
- Verifiers on destination chains enforce strict validation.



## 3. Mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Replay Attack | Include nonce and expiration in intent |
| Fake Relayer | Enforce signature from whitelisted relayers |
| Chain Reorg | Add finality buffer before execution |
| DoS | Relayer rate-limiting and circuit breakers |
| Misuse of Protocol | Fee tiering + identity-based verification (KIP-CK NFT Partnership) |



## 4. Recommendations

- All smart contracts should be audited before mainnet.
- Verifiers should be isolated, modular, and gas-efficient.
- Relayer infra must enforce logging, TLS, and container isolation.
- Encourage open bug bounty program after testnet.
