# KIP-CK Web-Based Demo

This is a simple web-based simulation of the KIP-CK Protocol's cross-chain transaction flow.  
It is built for grant reviewers, early testers, and ecosystem partners to visualize how KIP-CK works at the front-end level.

---

## What This Demo Shows

- User signs an intent off-chain
- The relayer forwards the transaction to a destination chain
- Signature is verified
- The transaction is executed on behalf of the user



## How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No setup or backend needed.  
Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

> You can also deploy it to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify for online access.



## Screenshots

Include CLI version or Web version screenshots here (optional for better clarity).



## Note

This demo is for **simulation purposes only**. No actual blockchain is involved yet â€” it mimics the interaction logic to support early visualization before full testnet deployment.
