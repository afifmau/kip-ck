USDT Cross-Chain Transfer â€“ KIP-CK Protocol

This document explains how the KIP-CK Protocol simulates and plans to handle cross-chain transfers of stablecoins, with a focus on USDT as the initial supported asset.

Why Start with USDT?

One of the most widely used stablecoins across EVM and non-EVM chains

Supported by multiple Layer 1s and Layer 2s (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Sui, Aptos, etc.)

Popular for DeFi, payments, and remittances

Simulated Transfer Flow

Example: Transfer USDT from Ethereum to Sui via KIP-CK

1. User signs intent (to transfer X USDT from Chain A to Chain B)


2. Relayer picks up the signed payload


3. KIP-CK contract on Chain A locks or burns the asset


4. KIP-CK relayer verifies and submits to Chain B


5. KIP-CK contract on Chain B mints or releases USDT equivalent


6. User receives USDT on destination chain



> âœ… All steps are abstracted for the user, only one approval + signature needed.

No Bridges?

Correct. KIP-CK does not use bridges.
Instead, we rely on:

Off-chain meta-transaction relayer

Signature verification

Canonical contracts on each chain with logic coordination

Current Test Targets

Chain	Status

Ethereum	âœ… Simulated
Aptos	âœ… Simulated
ICP	ðŸ”œ Planned
Sui	ðŸ”œ Planned



---

USDT Security Notes

Only trusted USDT contracts will be whitelisted

Any custom asset must go through a verification + registration process

All cross-chain balances are traceable via public explorer (coming soon)



---

Future Expansion

Add support for USDC, DAI, and wrapped stablecoins

Allow multi-hop routing (e.g., Ethereum â†’ Aptos â†’ ICP)

Create fee tiering for large volume USDT flows
