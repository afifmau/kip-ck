 Public Testnet Plan – KIP-CK Protocol

This document outlines the strategy and goals for launching the public testnet phase of the KIP-CK Protocol.


---

 Objectives

Validate cross-chain transaction logic in real blockchain environments

Stress test relayer performance under various load conditions

Gather feedback from developers and early users

Ensure smooth integration across EVM and non-EVM chains (e.g., Aptos, ICP)



---

🗓️ Timeline

Phase	Description	Status

Internal Testing	Private testing with mock chains	✅ Done
Web-Based Demo	CLI + Web simulation for grant reviewers	✅ Done
Initial Testnet Phase	Limited devnet integration (EVM + Aptos)	🚧 Ongoing
Public Testnet	Open access to protocol + relayer infra	🔜 Mid/Late July
Finalization	Test results evaluation & final tweaks	🔜 Post-July



---

 What Will Be Included

Smart contracts deployed on at least 2 testnets (EVM + Non-EVM)

Meta-transaction relayer service for subsidized gas

Basic SDK/API for interacting with protocol components

Web frontend (simulation & testnet dApp)



---

 Developer Involvement

Open GitHub issues for feedback & improvement

Invite-only feedback group on Telegram (optional)

Public documentation & tutorials



---

 Security & Risk Disclosure

All users will be notified that the testnet is experimental.
KIP-CK will display warnings for:

Unverified contracts

Chains not fully audited

Possible simulation mismatch with mainnet behavior



---

 Note

Public testnet is a non-production environment.
Funds and assets used in testing have no real value.
