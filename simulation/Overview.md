# Overview – KIP-CK Simulation

This folder contains early simulations and mockups demonstrating the KIP-CK protocol's core functionality, particularly its **cross-chain transaction flow** without relying on traditional bridges.

---

## Purpose

- Visualize the user experience (UX) for cross-chain actions
- Showcase how intent-based architecture works via simulation
- Allow early-stage feedback from reviewers and grant evaluators

---

## Contents

- `meta-tx-demo.md` — Describes intent signing and relayer flow
- `usdt-crosschain.md` — Concept of cross-chain USDT transfer simulation
- `rencana-testnet-publik.md` — (To be translated) Testnet rollout plans
- `Web-demo/` — Minimal frontend simulation (HTML + JS)

---

## Note

These simulations are **not real on-chain interactions** — they aim to simplify understanding and validate design assumptions before mainnet or testnet deployment.
