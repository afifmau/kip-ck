# 🗺️ Roadmap – KIP-CK Protocol

This document outlines the development milestones of the KIP-CK protocol — from research and simulation to public adoption and standardization.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Research & Design (Q2 2024)

- ✅ Defined core architecture (bridge-less, relayer-based)
- ✅ Designed message format and signature schemes
- ✅ Outlined EVM and non-EVM interoperability flow
- ✅ Drafted forwarder pattern and gasless mechanism

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: Simulation & Documentation (Q3 2024)

- 🛠 Write complete technical documentation (in progress)
- 🧪 Build simulations of meta-transactions and relayer flow
- 🌐 Create GitHub repo with modular design and examples
- 📂 Prepare reference implementations for EVM and Aptos

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Devnet Launch (Q3/Q4 2024)

- 🔌 Deploy forwarders on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism
- 📡 Open public devnet for testing
- 🧑‍🔬 Invite developers to stress-test the protocol
- 📝 Publish test results and performance benchmark

---

## 🌉 Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (Q4 2024)

- 🔄 Integrate with EVM-based dApps and wallets
- 🧩 Provide SDKs and adapters for non-EVM chains
- 👥 Start early adopter grants (depending on funding)

---

## 🌍 Phase 5: Standardization & Governance (2025)

- 📜 Submit EIP/KIP draft for standardization
- 🧑‍⚖️ Build open governance mechanism (community relayer registry, validator incentives, etc.)
- 📢 Collaborate with ecosystem partners to formalize integration standards

---

## 🧭 Future Directions

- ⚡ Instant execution optimization (~5s intent-to-execute target)
- 🔐 Zero-knowledge proof validation for forwarders
- 🌐 L1/L2 unification via stateless message passing
- 💳 UX integrations (gasless cross-chain login, session keys, embedded wallets)
- 🪙 Optional token model for sustainability (TBD, non-critical)

---

## 🎯 Vision

KIP-CK aims to become the **simplest, safest, and most universal cross-chain intent protocol** — accessible by any developer, on any chain, without needing bridges or wrapped tokens.
